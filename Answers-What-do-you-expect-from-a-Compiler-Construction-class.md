### "What do you expect from a Compiler Construction class?"

#### Comments to Answers

(to be continued)

- "I expect to learn how a compiler turns a high level language into **binary**"

        The closest we can get in this course to hardware is byte code of the Java Virtual Machine. 
        It is very similar to assembly already, so it shows at least the principles at work. 
        But last year, we didn't get to that point due to lack of time. 
        I hope that going through the course a second time, will allow me to be faster, but I don't want to promise too much.

- "I would really like to learn how to use a debugger, optimization, and settings to compile for **specific hardware**, a wide variety of hardware, or develop for a custom device that does not have a traditional x86 or arm processor."

        Let me know if there is more interest in this.
        Maybe we could have an elective on more hardware related topics.

- "compiling from code into **DNA** in order to program cell behavior"

        I don't know anything about this but would love to learn more.
        If there is more interest on this, let me know, maybe we can explore this further.

- "how the **debugger** in a compiler detects errors", "I have wondered why some compilers correctly trace some syntax errors to the problem source code, but sometimes don't provide useful error messages."

        We will certainly learn how the basic mechanism of creating error messages works. 
        How to create better error messages could be an interestin project on the side.
        How to actually implement debuggers is beyond the scope of the course.
        But again, if there is more interest, maybe we can develop this a bit further.

- "Specifically, it would be good to learn what exactly makes a compiler **efficient/optimimal** for a system by studying the individual parts of compilation process." "I want to learn how to build an efficient and fast compiler"

        I think understanding the basics of compiler construction is already an achievement for a one semester course. 
        So I didn't pay much attention to efficiency. But let us keep an eye on it.

- "Essentially, what code properties are exploited to make more efficient code, and how I can take advantage of that as a programmer."

        If you know what optimzations the compiler can do, you can write more elegant code, 
        leaving the optimization to the compiler. 
        But when do you need to optimize yourself? 
        I am not sure we have time for this, but if there is interest, 
        maybe we can do sth on this ... let me know ...

- "Sometimes **performance** [of the compiled code] increases dramatically if the programmer knows how the compiler functions."

        I payed more attention to the question of how knowledge about compilers influences 
        the design rather than the performance of programming languages. 
        But I am happy to take this aspect into account as well. 
        If you have any questions or examples on this topic let me know, 
        this is certainly worth digging into it.

- "I am most interested in tokenizing and parsing as I come across these with data in my job frequently."

        We will learn the basic theory of tokenzing and parsing and then use a tool 
        that generates tokenizer and parser from the grammar automatically. 
        Let me know if you want to dig deeper into this.

- "I want to learn about things like why not all languages require type declarations."

        In a nutshell, it depends on whether you want error messages at compile time, 
        or whether you are happy with run-time errors. We will hear more about this later in the course, 
        but keep on asking if you want to know more now ...
