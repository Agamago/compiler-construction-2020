# Git best practices

I collect here some lessons learned from using git for [assignments](assignments.md). 

- Create a github repository for this course.
- Conceptually, the repo is your repo for the duration of the course.
- Use this same git repository for all assignments. 
- Make meaningful subfolders such as `Assignment1`.
- Use the repo to create a trail of your work. Commit often.
- Break your assignments into milestones. Make sure all milestones are pushed.
- Do not create different versions by copying files. Use branches.
- Do not track/commit/push automatically generated files. 
- Avoid unthinking use of `git add *`. Only add files that should be tracked. 
- Consider using a `.gitignore`.
