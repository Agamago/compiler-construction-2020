# Git best practices

I collect here some lessons learned from using git for [assignments](assignments.md). Some of them will apply only for next year.

- Create a github repository for this course.
- Conceptually, the repo is your repo for the duration of the course.
- Assignment 1 will be individual work. Every student will invite me as a collaborator and document the progress on Assignment 1 by regularly updating git. Proper use of git will be considered for grading.
- Assignments 2-5 can be done in group work. To manage collaboration in the group, it makes sense to make a repo for each group. 
- Unless there are major changes in the composition of the groups, do not make a new repo for a new assignment. Rather create meaningful subfolders such as `Assignment1`, etc.
- Use the repo to create a trail of your work. Commit often.
- Break your assignments into milestones. Make sure all milestones are pushed.
- Do not create different versions by copying files. Use branches.
- Do not track/commit/push automatically generated files. 
- Avoid unthinking use of `git add *`. Only add files that should be tracked. 
- Consider using a `.gitignore`.
