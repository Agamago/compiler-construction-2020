## Discussion Forum

For a more collaborative learning experience, I want to reward participation in asking, discussing and answering questions on this [google group](https://groups.google.com/forum/?pli=1#!forum/chapman-compiler-construction-2020) with up to 5% of the total points, see [Assessment](assessment.md) for details. 

As I want this forum to be a space for collaborative learning, I will grade participation, not the correctness of answers.

Ideally, I would leave this space largely to you, the students, and answer to questions or comment on discussions twice a week at the beginning of each lecture. But of course I will try to answer all questions. 

**I will assume that you follow the discussions. I will accept no excuses if you missed material or announcements because you didn't. I recommend that you set the settings to receive "All email".**

To get things going, I will from time to time pose questions and topics for disucssion. But feel free to take the initiative.

Let us see how this will work. As always, I am happy to take suggestions on board to improve the course.

I manage the settings of the group so that only members have the right to post and read. Members are students who take the class and myself.

If you didn't get an invitation, send me an email.

Below I will post comments to some of the discussions on the forum if I find the time. Maybe this will evolve into a list of FAQs. But, as I said, I assume that you read the discussions anyway, so do not rely on the below.
